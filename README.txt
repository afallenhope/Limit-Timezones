Limit Timezone
---------------
This will filter the list of selectable timezones from the giant list.

 
 Usage
 ------
 
  * Setup your default country timezone and save it by going to "Admin -> Config -> Limit Timezone Settings"
    
  
Restrictions
-------------

  * Right now, it's small and it's only limiting on user profile page (seeing as that's initially what I wanted).
  * It  can easily modified to work on ANY form though, simply remove the conditional statement.
  

Future Development
------------------
  
  * I'd really like to get this module more of a kick, if you have any suggestion for features or any bug reports
    please see the contact info.
